Check if there was a spike in lag when KTP rate exceeded a threshold (20k). 



Logs for lag: `Logging lag for metricsforge_data_consumer`


1. Get all _timestamps_ + _ktps_ where rate was over 20000
2. Check the lag nearby each timestamp and ktp 
3. Compare it with the normal lag

What I have to check?
