Check if there was a spike in lag when KTP rate exceeded a threshold (20k). 



Logs for lag: `Logging lag for metricsforge_data_consumer`


1. Get all _timestamps_ + _ktps_ where rate was over 20000
2. Check the lag nearby each timestamp and ktp 
3. Compare it with the normal lag

#### What I have to check?

We have only 10 ktps with biggest lag each time (per node) => not true? -> ==ask Wojtek==

What to do?
For each ktp do a separate analysis?

For each ktp get timestamps where there was a rate over a threshold.

Then do the separate analysis per ktp.
Get `Logging lag for` logs and check if there is a significant increase in lag around high rate of dps.

First, analyse: '0000000000520B73-metrics_raw_data-4'
