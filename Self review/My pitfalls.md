1. Analysis of alarm triggers. Took too much time
2. Lack of motivation (procrastination) when there is nobody else from my team in the office. üëç
1. Too many (long !) periods of watching smartphone screen. üëç
2. Dropping a topic of moving `PastFutureDropper` to receiver (go to Szymon with that)
3. Alerts, too much time spent on python script and messing around with data.
4. I'm too easily distracted. Not focused on the current task. 

	I should've run simple queries to assess how much impact it would have had on the alarm triggering with different thresholds.
